# Surface-Disconformity-Measurement

## Purpose
- This project was created for a freelance client that needed a custom device to measure the surface disconformity of various rock formations in a way that could be graphed for visual interpretation. 

## Mechanical Design
- Accommodating for rough terrain, lawnmower wheels were chosen for their practicality and low cost. Based on this design choice, the wheel brackets were modeled to attach four rubber lawnmower wheels to a surplus wooden plank from a local hardware store. The lawnmower wheel bolts also function as independant axels for each wheel.
- For maneuverability, two screw eyes were fastened to the rear of the cart for a hook connected to an extension arm to attach. This allows the user to carefully pull the cart across the surface rock for measurement. 
- The device was also designed to be assembled and disassembled without any tools needed so it could be shipped via UPS. 

## Electrical Design
- The microcontroller chosen for this project was the Elegoo Uno R3. While this is certainly not the best microcontroller for this project, it did the job just fine. 

(Note: to keep costs low, off-the-shelf components were used for the majority of the project)
